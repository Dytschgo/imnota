# Development

## Local setup

Use the repository's pinned pnpm workflow:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
corepack pnpm dev
```

The dev command runs Vite, the Electron TypeScript watcher and Electron together. It waits for both `http://127.0.0.1:5173` and the compiled Electron entry point before launching the desktop app.

Some shells and parent tools set `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`. Passing that value to Electron makes the Electron executable behave like Node.js, so the desktop app never opens. `scripts/dev-electron.mjs` creates a copy of the inherited environment, removes only `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`, and launches Electron with inherited stdio. The `VITE_DEV_SERVER_URL` set by the dev command and every other environment value remain available to Electron. The helper forwards `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM` and `SIGHUP` to the child and mirrors Electron's exit code or signal.

Test the helper directly:

```bash
node --test scripts/dev-electron.test.mjs
```

## Quality checks

Before committing a source change, run the relevant checks:

```bash
corepack pnpm format:check
corepack pnpm lint
corepack pnpm typecheck
corepack pnpm test
corepack pnpm build
```

For documentation-only changes, run Prettier against the owned Markdown files. Do not rewrite unrelated files merely to satisfy broad formatting output.

Manual macOS launch and cross-editor clipboard acceptance are separate checks; a Windows development launch or automated Electron clipboard test cannot establish either result.
